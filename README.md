# Pillar 2: Application Architecture

## Microservices vs. Monolithic

### Microservices
Microservices architecture involves breaking down an application into smaller, independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. Key characteristics include:

- **Decoupled Services:** Each service is self-contained and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
- **Technology Diversity:** Different services can use different technologies and programming languages.
- **Resilience:** Fault isolation ensures that the failure of one service does not impact the entire system.

### Monolithic
Monolithic architecture involves building an application as a single, cohesive unit. Key characteristics include:

- **Single Codebase:** All functionality is contained within a single codebase.
- **Tightly Coupled:** Components are interconnected and interdependent, making the application easier to develop initially but harder to scale and maintain.
- **Simplicity:** Easier to develop and deploy initially, suitable for small to medium-sized applications.

### Hybrid Approach
A hybrid approach combines elements of both microservices and monolithic architectures. This often involves starting with a monolithic architecture and breaking parts of it into microservices as the need arises. Key characteristics include:

- **Incremental Refactoring:** Gradually decouple services from the monolith based on evolving requirements and scaling needs.
- **Flexibility:** Allows for a balanced approach, leveraging the simplicity of a monolith and the scalability of microservices.
- **Transitional Strategy:** Provides a path for legacy applications to evolve into a more modular and scalable architecture.

## Separation of Frontend and Backend

Separating frontend and backend components of an application can enhance modularity, scalability, and maintainability. Key considerations include:

- **Independent Development:** Frontend and backend teams can work independently, using different technologies and release cycles.
- **API-Driven Communication:** Frontend communicates with the backend via APIs, enabling flexibility in frontend frameworks and backend services.
- **Scalability:** Each component can be scaled independently based on its specific needs and traffic patterns.

## Design Patterns

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. For a comprehensive list of design patterns, refer to [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns). Key patterns include:

- **MVC (Model-View-Controller):** Separates an application into three interconnected components: Model (data), View (UI), and Controller (business logic).
- **Repository Pattern:** Abstracts data access logic into a repository class, decoupling the data layer from the business logic.
- **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):** Structures the application as a collection of services that communicate over a network.

## Scalability and Performance

Designing for scalability and performance ensures that an application can handle increased load and deliver a responsive user experience. Key considerations include:

- **Horizontal Scaling:** Add more instances of services to handle increased load.
- **Vertical Scaling:** Increase the capacity of existing instances.
- **Caching:** Implement caching mechanisms to reduce database load and improve response times.
- **Load Balancing:** Distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.

## Modernizing the Twelve-Factor App

The Twelve-Factor App methodology provides best practices for building modern, scalable applications. Here are modernized sections based on its principles:

### Codebase
Maintain a single codebase tracked in version control, with multiple deploys. This ensures consistency and simplifies the deployment process.

It's crucial to maintain a single codebase per application. This includes version control systems like Git, which allows for multiple deployments and consistent updates.

### Dependencies
Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies to ensure that the application can run consistently across different environments.

Dependency management tools like Composer, npm, Maven, or Gradle ensure that all necessary libraries and dependencies are explicitly declared and versioned.

### Config

- **Runtime Configuration:** Store configuration in the environment to separate it from code, making it easier to manage and change configurations without modifying the codebase.
- **Application State Configuration:** Can be stored in the environment or a configuration service, ensuring consistency across different environments.
- **Dynamic Configuration:** Should not require redeployment of the application. Use configuration services or databases to manage dynamic settings.

Modern configuration management often utilizes tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and HashiCorp Vault to manage and secure environment-specific configurations and secrets.

### Secrets Management

Store secrets (e.g., API keys, passwords) separately from configuration, using dedicated secrets management services to ensure security and ease of rotation.

### Backing Services

Treat backing services (databases, message brokers, etc.) as attached resources that can be swapped without changing the application code.

Using cloud services like AWS RDS for databases or RabbitMQ for messaging allows for flexible and interchangeable backing services.

### Build, Release, Run

Separate the build, release, and run stages to ensure that each stage is distinct and repeatable, reducing the risk of errors during deployment.

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) automate these stages to ensure consistency and reliability.

### Processes

Execute the application as one or more stateless processes, ensuring that any data that needs to persist is stored in a stateful backing service.

Stateless processes are managed and scaled using container orchestration tools like Kubernetes, which also handle the stateful services through persistent volumes.

### Port Binding

Export services via port binding, making the application self-contained and independent of the runtime environment.

Applications expose services via ports, making them accessible over the network, often managed by containerization tools.

### Concurrency

Scale out the application by running multiple instances of stateless processes to handle increased load.

Scaling horizontally by running multiple instances of processes is facilitated by cloud services like AWS ECS or Kubernetes.

### Disposability

Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown, ensuring that the application can quickly recover from failures.

Fast startup and graceful shutdown are critical for handling traffic spikes and deploying updates without downtime, supported by practices in container management.

### Dev/Prod Parity

Keep development, staging, and production environments as similar as possible to reduce the risk of deployment issues.

Keeping environments as similar as possible helps in identifying issues early and ensures smoother deployments. Tools like Docker help in creating consistent environments.

### Logs

Treat logs as event streams, allowing for centralized log management and analysis.

Centralized logging solutions like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Datadog or Splunk provide robust log management and analysis capabilities.

### Admin Processes

Run administrative or management tasks as one-off processes, ensuring they are separate from the main application codebase.

Running administrative tasks as one-off processes ensures they don't interfere with the main application workflow, often automated through scripts or specialized tools.

By implementing these principles, organizations can build applications that are easier to manage, scale, and maintain.
